# Our values
These values reflect who we are and help us make decisions about business, product, and culture. These are the ideals that keep us grounded.

## Drive growth for our customers
Everything we do is focused on helping our customers drive growth for their business. Our individual efforts combine together to bring value to our customers - we depend on their success just as much as they depend on ours.

## Make an impact
Our team is empowered with a clear understanding of our vision to drive a strong footprint in our collective journey. We are all our own CEOs and our contributions are transformational. We experience the journey together.

## Embrace chutzpah
Weâ€™re always challenging existing paradigms. We set new standards, uncover deeper stories and boldly take on challenges. We apply the Chutzpah mindset to our industry, our product, our customers, and ourselves.

## Unify exceptional people
We believe in building deep connections - between teams, cultures and yes, even systems. Our team is a unique combination of high IQ, EQ and AQ. We care more about accomplishment than credit. These are the people we want to work with the rest of our lives.
